The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, has been catalogued by the World Health Organization as a public health international emergency. Cases have been identified in countries all around the world, with 249.507.923 cases and 5.044.654 deaths reported by November 2021.

As an alternative, technological and scientific tools that allow further understanding on the spatial and temporal conditions favoring virus dissemination acquire importance. These non pharmaceutical solutions could be developed and deployed in order to complement and support pharmaceutical solutions. Furthermore, these tools could be applied for other respiratory virus (known or unknown) in the upcoming years.

we aim to build an analytical model capable of stratifying the risk of contracting acute respiratory infections, taking into account temporal and spatial characteristics from the specific context. The model has been tuned with the public data available in Bogot√° and Colombia, but in the future could be applied to different cities and countries, as well as to other transmittable diseases.
